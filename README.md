# Overview

The **Push Manifesto** is a set of principles and values that guide organizations and individuals in the pursuit of innovation and progress. It emphasizes the importance of having a clear vision, collaborating with others, and acting with determination and inclusive behaviors.

The manifesto prioritizes the journey of innovation over specific milestones and iterations, focusing on waypoints that allow for flexibility and adaptability. It also balances the desire for fit-for-purpose solutions with the goal of achieving shared value outcomes for users and stakeholders.

The **Push Manifesto**  also emphasizes the importance of evidence-based thinking and a scientific approach to problem-solving, which is crucial in exploring the latent space of innovation. It supports the use of a [Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration), which is a framework for measuring and assessing the maturity of an organization or project in a specific area.

Moreover, it is a pragmatic worldview, meaning it is practical and realistic, focused on identifying and implementing solutions that are feasible and have a high chance of success.

In summary, the Push Manifesto is a set of principles and values that guide organizations and individuals in their pursuit of innovation, it emphasizes the importance of vision, collaboration, inclusive behaviors, determination, communication, governance, learning, and a pragmatic mindset.

# Principles

  - **Push**: A push is a logical unit of output, a piece of work, that has a clear beginning, middle and end, with the end representing an outcome. It includes all work items, has value, and has an agreement of 'done' that is shared among all stakeholders. The push should not necessarily progress immediately to the next step, but should be completed in a way that everyone gets something out of it.

- **Ambiguity and Cognitive Bias**: Ambiguity and cognitive bias can kill projects, so it is important to offer high readability, clear mental models, support diverse audiences, adopt simple conventions, reduce complexity, take the least cost route, seek clarity and always question assumptions. An agnostic approach should be taken to avoid bias and to ensure that all options are considered.

- **Risk**: Managing risks is crucial to the success of a project. Continuously cite and counter risks to ensure that you are prepared for any potential obstacles. Adopt a proactive approach to risk management and take steps to mitigate potential risks.

- **Check-ins, Waypoints and Reviews**: Stand-ups are useful, but a low ceremony, less noisy approach to follow-up on work items is preferred. The top and bottom of the week is an ideal time for check-ins, waypoints, and reviews, with an emphasis on honesty and shared understanding.

- **Identify and remove Road Blocks**: Early identification of roadblocks is key, and an inclusive approach should be taken to remove them. Roadblocks should be identified and removed as soon as they are identified to avoid delays and ensure the smooth progress of the project.

- **Creating Shared Value**: An inclusive and humble approach should be taken to recognize that the project, while having value and benefits, contributes to wider goals. The project should be designed with the goal of creating shared value for all stakeholders.

- **Mise en place**: Don't start a project without preparing your "mise en place". This means getting all the necessary elements in place before starting the project.

- **Work Items**: Work items, tasks, and cards transform assets. Each work item should be linked to the corresponding asset, and results should be deposited in the appropriate place, with knowledge management being a first-class consideration.

- **Getting it Wrong**: Being learned, critical thinking, and taking a scientific approach will always help you climb those mountains. It's important to learn from mistakes and not repeat them.

- **Go Find Out**: Engage early and enough, even if to make friends. Get out of the chair and go find out. Do the work and don't repeat the
obvious. Don't rely on assumptions or preconceived notions, but go out and gather information and insights to inform your decision-making.

- **Know when to Roll Em**: Manage your work effort and dial in your approach. Don't push your luck and only kick a push when the conditions are favorable. Recognize that Murphy's Law applies, and be prepared for the unexpected.

- **Hypothesis**: Every great idea starts with a test strategy. It's important to ensure that ideas can be tested and validated before proceeding with implementation. This helps to ensure that the idea is feasible and has a high chance of success.

## Notes

 - "Mise en place" is a French term that translates to "put in place" or "everything in its place." In the culinary world, it refers to the practice of preparing and organizing all ingredients and equipment before beginning to cook. This includes measuring and chopping ingredients, preparing equipment, and organizing everything in a way that makes the cooking process more efficient and streamlined.  In a broader sense, the term "mise en place" can refer to any situation where everything is prepared and organized in advance in order to ensure a smooth and efficient process. This can be applied to any type of project or task, from cooking to software development, and it's about having everything ready before starting, in order to have a seamless execution. In simple words, it's about being prepared and having all necessary elements in place before starting a project or task.
