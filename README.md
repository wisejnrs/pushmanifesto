# Overview

**"Push Manifesto"** is about vision, collaboration, inclusive behaviours, determination, communication, learning, and above all prioritizes the _journey_; using _waypoints_ over itterations and milestones, balancing desire for fit-for-purpose, targeting shared value outcomes for users and stake holders.

**"Push Manifesto"** feeds the Maturity Model, evidence-based mindset, supporting the scientific approach daring to explore the latent space, with a pragmatic world-view.

# Principles

- **Push:** a logical unit of output that has a beginning, middle and end. 'End' generally represents an outcome, doesn't need to immediately progress to the next, includes all work items, has value, has an agreement of **'Done'**; _everybody gets something_.
- **Ambiguity and Cognitive Bias:** these kill projects. Offer high readability,clear mental models, support diverse audiences, adopt simple conventions, reduced complexity, take the least cost route, seek clarity and always, always question. Take an agnostic approach.
- **Risk:** kill projects. You don't get to space by crossing your fingers, continuously cite and counter risks. Pretty sure Babbage, Bool and Bayes knew Murphy.
- **Check-ins, Waypoints and Reviews:** whilst stand-ups are useful, a low ceremony, less noisy approach to follow-up on work items, prefer top and bottom of the week, honesty and shared understanding. In other words, "you're child's report card should not be a surprise, by virtue of care and involvement.
- **Identify and remove Road Blocks:** early identification is key with an inclusive approach taken. 
- **Creating Shared Value:** inclusive and humble approach in recognition that your project, whilst having value and benefits contributes to wider goals.
- **Mise en place:** don't start a project without your Mise en place done, get those vegetables chopped.  
- **Work Items:** work items, tasks and cards transform Assets. Link the work item to the asset. **Don't** deposit results back in to the task. Knowledge management is first-class. 
- **Getting it Wrong:** being learned, critical thinking and taking a scientific approach will always help you climb those mountains. 
- **Go Find Out:** engage. Engage early, and enough, even if to make friends. Get out of the chair and go find out. Do the work, and don't repeat the obvious. 
- **Know when to Roll Em:** manage your work effort, dial in your approach and don't push your luck. Only kick a push if the conditions are favourable. If it can go wrong it will - Murhpy's law applies. 
- **Hypothesis:** every great _idea_ starts with a Test Strategy. It doesn't exist if it can't be tested.
