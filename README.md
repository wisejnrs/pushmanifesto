# Overview

The **Push Manifesto** is a set of principles and values that guide organizations and individuals in the pursuit of innovation and progress. It emphasizes the importance of having a clear vision, collaborating with others, and acting with determination and inclusive behaviors.

The manifesto prioritizes the journey of innovation over specific milestones and iterations, focusing on waypoints that allow for flexibility and adaptability. It also balances the desire for fit-for-purpose solutions with the goal of achieving shared value outcomes for users and stakeholders.

The **Push Manifesto**  also emphasizes the importance of evidence-based thinking and a scientific approach to problem-solving, which is crucial in exploring the latent space of innovation. It supports the use of a [Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration), which is a framework for measuring and assessing the maturity of an organization or project in a specific area.

Moreover, it is a pragmatic worldview, meaning it is practical and realistic, focused on identifying and implementing solutions that are feasible and have a high chance of success.

In summary, the Push Manifesto is a set of principles and values that guide organizations and individuals in their pursuit of innovation, it emphasizes the importance of vision, collaboration, inclusive behaviors, determination, communication, governance, learning, and a pragmatic mindset. It also emphasizes the use of evidence-based thinking and a scientific approach to problem-solving, with the goal of achieving shared value outcomes for users and stakeholders.

# Principles

  - **Push**: A push is a logical unit of output, a piece of work, that has a clear beginning, middle and end, with the end representing an outcome. It includes all work items, has value, and has an agreement of 'done' that is shared among all stakeholders. The push should not necessarily progress immediately to the next step, but should be completed in a way that everyone gets something out of it.

- **Ambiguity and Cognitive Bias**: Ambiguity and cognitive bias can have a profound impact on the outcomes of any project. These issues can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and ultimately, a failure to meet project objectives. For example, ambiguity can result in confusion about project goals, requirements, or deadlines, which can lead to delays or missed opportunities. Meanwhile, cognitive bias can lead to flawed decision-making, a lack of consideration for alternative approaches, and an over-reliance on personal biases or assumptions. To mitigate the impact of these issues, it is essential to prioritize high readability and clear mental models, as well as to support diverse audiences and adopt simple conventions that reduce complexity. Taking the least cost route can also help to avoid ambiguity and reduce the risk of cognitive bias. Additionally, seeking clarity and questioning assumptions is crucial to ensure that all options are considered and to avoid making decisions based on personal biases. An agnostic approach should be taken to avoid bias and to ensure that all possibilities are thoroughly considered. By following these guidelines, project managers can reduce the risk of miscommunication, misunderstandings, and cognitive biases, and increase the likelihood of successful project outcomes.

- **Risk**: Managing risks is crucial to the success of a project. Continuously cite and counter risks to ensure that you are prepared for any potential obstacles. Adopt a proactive approach to risk management and take steps to mitigate potential risks.

- **Check-ins, Waypoints and Reviews**: Stand-ups are useful, but a low ceremony, less noisy approach to follow-up on work items is preferred. The top and bottom of the week is an ideal time for check-ins, waypoints, and reviews, with an emphasis on honesty and shared understanding.

- **Identify and remove Road Blocks**: Early identification of roadblocks is key, and an inclusive approach should be taken to remove them. Roadblocks should be identified and removed as soon as they are identified to avoid delays and ensure the smooth progress of the project.

- **Creating Shared Value**: Creating shared value is a critical component of successful project management. It means designing projects with the goal of creating value not only for the organization but also for all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, and the wider community. To achieve this, an inclusive and humble approach should be taken, recognizing that the project is part of a larger system and that its success is dependent on the success of others. For example, a project that aims to reduce waste and environmental impact may benefit the company by reducing costs and improving its reputation, but it can also benefit the wider community by creating a cleaner and more sustainable environment. By taking a shared value approach, the project can be designed to have a positive impact on multiple stakeholders, creating a virtuous cycle of benefits that can help to ensure its long-term success. This approach can also help to build trust and goodwill among stakeholders, which can be valuable in achieving buy-in and support for future projects. Ultimately, creating shared value is about recognizing that success is not just about achieving individual goals, but about contributing to the common good.

- **Mise en place**: Mise en place is a critical concept in project management. It means taking the time to get all the necessary elements in place before starting the project. This can include things like gathering resources, defining project scope, setting goals and timelines, identifying risks and potential issues, and ensuring that team members have the necessary skills and training to complete the project successfully. By taking the time to prepare your mise en place, you can reduce the risk of unexpected delays, budget overruns, and other issues that can derail a project. Additionally, having a clear plan in place from the beginning can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. While it may take extra time and effort upfront, investing in your mise en place is a critical component of any successful project.

- **Work Items**: Work items, tasks, and cards transform assets. Each work item should be linked to the corresponding asset, and results should be deposited in the appropriate place, with knowledge management being a first-class consideration.

- **Getting it Wrong**: Being learned, critical thinking, and taking a scientific approach will always help you climb those mountains. It's important to learn from mistakes and not repeat them.

- **Go Find Out**: Engage early and enough, even if to make friends. Get out of the chair and go find out. Do the work and don't repeat the
obvious. Don't rely on assumptions or preconceived notions, but go out and gather information and insights to inform your decision-making.

- **Know when to Roll Em**: Manage your work effort and dial in your approach. Don't push your luck and only kick a push when the conditions are favorable. Recognize that Murphy's Law applies, and be prepared for the unexpected.

- **Hypothesis**: Every great idea starts with a test strategy. It's important to ensure that ideas can be tested and validated before proceeding with implementation. This helps to ensure that the idea is feasible and has a high chance of success.

## Notes

 - "Mise en place" is a French term that translates to "put in place" or "everything in its place." In the culinary world, it refers to the practice of preparing and organizing all ingredients and equipment before beginning to cook. This includes measuring and chopping ingredients, preparing equipment, and organizing everything in a way that makes the cooking process more efficient and streamlined.  In a broader sense, the term "mise en place" can refer to any situation where everything is prepared and organized in advance in order to ensure a smooth and efficient process. This can be applied to any type of project or task, from cooking to software development, and it's about having everything ready before starting, in order to have a seamless execution. In simple words, it's about being prepared and having all necessary elements in place before starting a project or task.
