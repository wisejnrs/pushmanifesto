# Principles

  - **Push**: The concept of a push goes beyond just a unit of work, as it embodies a set of values and principles that guide the pursuit of innovation and progress. A push is more than just a deliverable - it represents a shared understanding of what needs to be achieved, and how success will be measured.
A push is not just a single, isolated output, but rather a building block that contributes to a larger goal or vision. It should be designed with the end user or customer in mind, with the aim of creating shared value for all stakeholders involved.
In addition, the concept of a push emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication. The agreement of 'done' should be shared among all stakeholders, and everyone involved should understand what they need to do to ensure the success of the push.
Finally, a push should not be viewed as a one-and-done output, but rather as part of an ongoing process of learning and iteration. Each push should provide value in its own right, while also contributing to a larger effort of continuous improvement and innovation.

- **Ambiguity and Cognitive Bias**: Ambiguity and cognitive bias can have a profound impact on the outcomes of any project. These issues can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and ultimately, a failure to meet project objectives. For example, ambiguity can result in confusion about project goals, requirements, or deadlines, which can lead to delays or missed opportunities. Meanwhile, cognitive bias can lead to flawed decision-making, a lack of consideration for alternative approaches, and an over-reliance on personal biases or assumptions. To mitigate the impact of these issues, it is essential to prioritize high readability and clear mental models, as well as to support diverse audiences and adopt simple conventions that reduce complexity. Taking the least cost route can also help to avoid ambiguity and reduce the risk of cognitive bias. Additionally, seeking clarity and questioning assumptions is crucial to ensure that all options are considered and to avoid making decisions based on personal biases. An agnostic approach should be taken to avoid bias and to ensure that all possibilities are thoroughly considered. By following these guidelines, project managers can reduce the risk of miscommunication, misunderstandings, and cognitive biases, and increase the likelihood of successful project outcomes.

- **Risk**: While risks are an inevitable part of any project, effective risk management can significantly increase the chances of success. The first step in managing risks is to identify and assess potential risks early on in the project lifecycle. Continuously monitoring and updating the risk register throughout the project is essential to ensure that risks are appropriately cited and countered.
A proactive approach to risk management involves taking steps to mitigate potential risks before they occur, rather than simply reacting to them after the fact. This may involve developing contingency plans, allocating resources to specific areas of risk, or re-evaluating project timelines to accommodate potential delays.
It's also important to maintain open lines of communication with all stakeholders throughout the project, to ensure that everyone is aware of potential risks and their potential impact. By keeping all parties informed and involved, it's easier to collectively address issues and make informed decisions.
Ultimately, managing risks is about being prepared for any potential obstacles that may arise. While it's impossible to eliminate all risks, adopting a proactive approach and taking steps to mitigate potential risks can help to minimize their impact and increase the likelihood of project success.

- **Check-ins, Waypoints and Reviews**:  Regular check-ins, waypoints, and reviews are crucial to keep the project on track and ensure that all team members are aligned and working towards shared goals. These should be conducted with a low ceremony and less noisy approach, avoiding unnecessary distractions and noise.
The timing of check-ins, waypoints, and reviews is important, with an emphasis on the top and bottom of the week as an ideal time to conduct them. During these check-ins, the team should focus on honesty and shared understanding to identify potential issues and address them promptly.
These reviews should be used as an opportunity to assess progress, identify any roadblocks or potential risks, and adjust the plan if necessary. By regularly conducting check-ins and reviews, the team can stay on track and adapt quickly to changing circumstances, ensuring the successful delivery of the project.

- **Identify and remove Road Blocks**: Identifying and removing roadblocks is crucial to keeping a project on track. To achieve this, it's important to take an inclusive approach that involves all stakeholders in the project. By proactively identifying potential roadblocks early on, the team can take action to remove them quickly and avoid unnecessary delays. This allows the project to move forward smoothly, reducing the risk of setbacks and ensuring that the team can deliver on their commitments.

- **Creating Shared Value**: Creating shared value is a critical component of successful project management. It means designing projects with the goal of creating value not only for the organization but also for all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, and the wider community. To achieve this, an inclusive and humble approach should be taken, recognizing that the project is part of a larger system and that its success is dependent on the success of others. For example, a project that aims to reduce waste and environmental impact may benefit the company by reducing costs and improving its reputation, but it can also benefit the wider community by creating a cleaner and more sustainable environment. By taking a shared value approach, the project can be designed to have a positive impact on multiple stakeholders, creating a virtuous cycle of benefits that can help to ensure its long-term success. This approach can also help to build trust and goodwill among stakeholders, which can be valuable in achieving buy-in and support for future projects. Ultimately, creating shared value is about recognizing that success is not just about achieving individual goals, but about contributing to the common good.

- **Mise en place**: Mise en place is a critical concept in project management. It means taking the time to get all the necessary elements in place before starting the project. This can include things like gathering resources, defining project scope, setting goals and timelines, identifying risks and potential issues, and ensuring that team members have the necessary skills and training to complete the project successfully. By taking the time to prepare your mise en place, you can reduce the risk of unexpected delays, budget overruns, and other issues that can derail a project. Additionally, having a clear plan in place from the beginning can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. While it may take extra time and effort upfront, investing in your mise en place is a critical component of any successful project.

- **Work Items**: Work items, tasks, and cards represent units of work that help transform assets. It is important to link each work item to the corresponding asset and ensure that results are deposited in the appropriate place, with knowledge management being a first-class consideration. This includes capturing insights, lessons learned, and best practices, and making them easily accessible to all stakeholders. By prioritizing knowledge management, the project can benefit from continuous learning and improvement, and avoid repeating mistakes or reinventing the wheel.

- **Getting it Wrong**: Failure is an inevitable part of the journey towards success. It's important to adopt a learning mindset, practice critical thinking, and take a scientific approach to overcome obstacles and reach goals. When mistakes happen, they should be analyzed to identify the root cause and prevent repetition in the future. Embracing a culture of continuous improvement and learning from failure can help individuals and organizations grow and achieve greater success.

- **Go Find Out**: It's important to engage early and often, even if it's just to build relationships. Don't stay in your chair and assume you know everything. Instead, actively seek out information and insights to inform your decision-making. Don't rely on assumptions or preconceived notions, and don't repeat what's already been done. By taking action and learning as much as possible, you can make more informed decisions and achieve better outcomes for your project.

- **Know when to Roll Em**: It's important to be aware of the state of the project and understand when it's time to pivot or shift gears. Monitor progress closely and be prepared to adjust your approach if necessary. Be mindful of factors that may impact the success of the project, and take action to address them proactively. At the same time, recognize that unforeseen challenges are bound to arise, and be prepared to adapt and pivot when necessary. Don't push forward blindly, but make informed decisions based on the current state of the project.

- **Hypothesis**: Every great idea starts with a hypothesis. It's important to define and test the hypothesis before proceeding with implementation. This helps to ensure that the idea is feasible and has a high chance of success. A hypothesis should be specific, testable, and falsifiable, and should be supported by evidence and data.
