# Overview

**"Push Manifesto"** is about vision, collaboration, inclusive behaviours, determination, communication, learning, and above all prioritizes the _journey_; using _waypoints_ over itterations and milestones, balancing desire and fit-for-purpose, targeting shared value outcomes for users and stake holders.

**"Push Manifesto"** feeds the Maturity Model, evidence-based mindset, supporting the scientific approach daring to explore the latent space, with a pragmatic world-view.

# Principles

- **Push:** a logical unit of output that has a beginning, middle and end. 'End' generally represents an outcome, doesn't need to immediately progress to the next, includes all work items, has value, has an agreement of **'Done'*; _everybody gets something_.
- **Ambiguity and Cognitive Bias:** these kill projects. Offer high readability,clear mental models, support diverse audiences, adopt simple conventions, reduced complexity, take the least cost route, seek clarity and always, always question. Take an agnostic approach.
- **Risk:** kill projects. You don't get to space by crossing your fingers, continuously cite and counter risks. Pretty sure Babbage, Bool and Bayes knew Murphy
